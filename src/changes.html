    <li>9th May 2019: Delete NAGs appearing before the first move of a game. $220 is
    sometimes used (e.g., by ChessPad) as a print-board indicator.

    <li>22nd Apr 2019: Improved --repetition so that it does not give false positives when
    castling rights or who is to move are different.

    <li>28th Mar 2019: Added --xroster to suppress tags that are not required with -R.

    <li>13th Nov 2018: Missing SetUp tags no longer elicit an error message as this contravention of the standard is so common.

    <li>28th Oct 2018: Negative value accepted with --dropply to indicates plies to be
    retained at the end of the game.

    <li>18th Oct 2018: open game files in binary mode to cope with the Ctrl
    characters that appear in some.

    <li>17th Oct 2018: Accept Z0 as an alternative to --.</li>

    by Hedinn Steingrimsson.</li>

    <li>23rd Apr 2018: With -R, include tags in the output that are not explicitly
    listed in the roster order. This aligns the behaviour with the documentation.</li>

    <li>9th Feb 2018: Suppress warning for null moves when --allownullmoves is used.
        With --fixresulttags, prefer the terminating result if either it or the result
        tag is "*".</li>

    <li>29th Dec 2017: Corrected failure to OR rather than AND the pseudo Elo
    tag used with -t.</li>

    <li>17th Dec 2017: Accepted multiple NAG comment pairs after a move.

    <li>8th July 2017: Added --plycount. With -z, use a FEN tag (if present) to count
    the number of pieces.</li>

    <li>6th July 2017: Adjusted -z to work correctly with a position stability value of 0.

    should be interpreted as a request to output the FEN encoding of the match position.</li>

    <li>28th June 2017: Added a c1 comment to -Wepd output to record the game's result.
    Added the requirement that the Variant tag contain the string "chess 960" to be

    moves in long-algebraic notation.</li>

    <li>6th June 2017: Added a second number to the -# flag to control file numbering.</li>
        
    <li>4th June 2017: Chess960 long algebraic castling notation accommodated

    can be fixed.</li>

        matches.</li>
        
    <li>Added text after -F for FEN-position output at arbitrary positions and not simply
    at the end of a game. Suggested by Josip Salai.</li>
    
    <li>22nd January 2017: Added --stopafter.</li>
        
    <li>20th January 2017: Added --nosetuptags and --onlysetuptags following a

      </ul></li>

    <li>12th January 2000
    C compiler with Red Hat Linux 6 was no longer happy with

        <li>Discarded writing to standard output in DOS version because of
        extensive problems trying to make this work with redirected
        output.  Instead, output is written to the file extract.pgn.
      </ul></li>

    <li>6th Jul 1994: Added -7 flag.</li>
