     *           CM: Chess Master input format.
     *     LALG: Long-algebraic, e.g. e2e4.
     *     HALG: Hyphenated long-algebraic, e.g. e2-e4.
     *     ELALG: Enhanced long-algebraic. Includes piece names, e.g. Ng1f3,
     *            and en-passant notation.
     *     XLALG: Enhanced long-algebraic. Includes piece names, e.g. Ng1f3,
     *            en-passant notation and either - or x between squares for
     *            non-capture and capture moves respectively.
     *     XOLALG: As XLALG but with O-O and O-O-O for castling moves.
     *     UCI: UCI-compatible format - actually LALG.
